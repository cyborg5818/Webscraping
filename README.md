# Webscraping
Web scraping is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites, but the enforce-ability of these terms is unclear. Always read the terms of use of the website you want to gather information from by data scraping.
